-- yarn --

* semi-standard can be used which enforces to use semicolon

-- React --

* return statement with braces, like (), allows multiple line return statement

* React props are read-only. It can only read from parent, but can't modify it

* Manually created components must be upper-cased. If its uppercased, react understands its created
manually, otherwise it'll put the element in DOM as it is

* To comment inside jsx, put js block and comment inside. Like {/* comment goes here */}

* Using key is important in iterator inside jsx

* propType shape is used to define an object. We should mention inside what are the keys available
and those should be defined explicitly. But propType object just checks for generic object. It doesn't
check whats available inside

* setState is required to update the state. If a state value is changed without setState, by directly
assigning value to it, the it won't re-render the DOM. There is watch associated with setState which
monitors state change and renders DOM. If setState is not used, the forceUpdate() function can be
used to re-render DOM forcibly
